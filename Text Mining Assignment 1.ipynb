    "We have used the Loughran and McDonald dictionary as it is better than the Harvard IV-4 dictionary in describing the negative content in financial context. The pessimism dictionaries were developed by social psychologists and not by people who have much knowledge about economics and finance. So, Loughran and McDonald visited this problem and pointed out that there are some words in these negative dictionaries that don't seem that they belong there. Words like 'vice' (meaning some kind of immoral behaviour), but in financial context, we seem to be talking about the vice-president of the company, etc, and words like 'tax' (meaning something that is struggling) are used in more general sense in finance, like the amount of tax the company paid in the last year.\n",
    "Therefore, there are some words in pessimism dictionaries that look that they don't belong in these dictionaries. So, for this reason we think that Loughran and McDonald dictionary is the most suitable for our application to analyse the Bank of England monetary policy meetings and the UK GDP.\n"
